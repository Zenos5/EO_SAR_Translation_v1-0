# EO_SAR_Translation_v1-0
Contains code to translate from EO to SAR images and vice versa to another using pix2pix, CycleGAN, and VQGAN.

## Programs
- image2image: contains VQGAN code
- pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix: contains pix2pix and CycleGAN code
- datasets: contains code for downloading datasets or using custom made datasets

For this project, I was helped by Spencer Low and Dersu Goorskey to find programs for sensor translation and a dataset to use.  I was also mentored by Oliver Nina and Ryan Farrell for this project.
